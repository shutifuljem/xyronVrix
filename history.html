<p><i>With the passing in congress of Republic Act No.236,during the incumbency of Governor Maddela and Congressman Leon C. Cabarrouguis, Diffun was created as a town of Nueva Vizcaya. 
By virtue of EC No.466,s1950. By then President Elpidio Quirino, diffunbecame a legal entity on July 2, 1950.
Mr.Silverio Pascua was appointed first Mayor of the new born Municipality.</p></i>

<p>Members of the newly created council and all the local people were invited to inspectthe proposed town site.
The Poblacion of Diffun was divided into the following districts: andres Bonifacio in the North; Rizal in the East; Aurora West in the South; and Disinaba, were the place near
the Sagat Creek was named Quezon, is now Aurora East.</p>

<p>Mr. Lucas Padilla was then appointed by the mayor as the Tenyente Del Barrio of Aurora East; but when, later on, 
he was appointed as the Municipal Vice Mayor, he was replaced by Mr. Nicolas Gorospe, who served from 1952-1953.</p>

<p>When the Central Central School was established in Aurora East in 1952, all possible development were focused in this area.
The Western and Southern portions of the school were pronounced by the Mayor as Teacher's Village.</p>

<p>Successors of Mr. Nicolas Gorospe as Barrio Lieutenant were late Mr. Gregorio Sibayan. During the term
of Mr. Gregorio Sibayan a certain parcel of land was used as a meeting place of Barrio Leader
and settlers. This place became a landmark and they called is Espino Hill in honor of the late Governor Jose Espino.</p>

<p>With the replacement of term Barrio by the term Barangay, and the title tenyente Del Barrio by the title
Barangay captain, Mr. Felipe Tacaca took over the leadership of Barangay Aurora East after having won
the election, and thence served for ten(10) years. He was succeeded by Mr. Adoracion Bergado(1982-1984). After him, Mr. Renato Antolin served for seven years(1984-1991).</p>

<p>Because of his desire to serve and reach more people, Mr. Antolin gave up his position in the Barangay
and ran for Vice Mayor. Mrs. Jeanette T. Cerveza, then the first councilor, took over as Barangay
Captain; and served in that position from 1994-1997. She was replaced by Mr. Roseller A. Escobar, who
won in June 1997 election.</p>

<p>Mr. Roseller A. Escobar, serving as Barangay Captain from July 1, 1997 to August 15, 2002, so skillfully
and progressively maneuvered his leadership ability to the extent that the Barangay won first place in
the Provincial Level Search for Model Barangay and Second Place in the Regional Level 1998.</p>

<p>In 2002, with his services engaged in the LGU Diffun, Mr. Escobar was succeeded by Mrs. Gloria C.
Antolin, who enthusiastically supported and pushed though the Barangay Projects, particularly in the
implementation of the clean ang green program of the previous leadership.</p>

<p>Mr.Escobar made a comeback as Barangay captain of Aurora East after winning in the 2007 elections.
His leadership garnered for the Barangay Most Outstanding Lupong Tagapamayapa Award for the years
2011-2014 (both Municipal and provincial Levels for the category 1st -3rd Class Municipalities); and was a consistent
nominee during the same period. The only Barangay Leader to have so far handled three
consecutive terms in a row, Mr. Escobar steps down his last term expires in 2016.</p>

<p>As Mr.Escobar ran and won as Sangguniang Bayan of Diffun, Mrs. Violy P. Merlin, then the first
councilor took over as Punong Barangay and service since July 2016 to present.</p>

<p>Barangay Aurora East itself with the distinction of being home to a few notable personalities-prominent
residents such as two past Governors of Quirino: Hon. Mariano J. Pimentel and Hon. josie C. Co; the
current Provincial Vice Governor, Hon.May Garnace Calaunan and many other successful businessmen
and civil servants.</p>

<p>Today, Barangay Aurora East faces the New Millennium with absolute optimism and confidence towards
socio economic stability and progress.</p>
